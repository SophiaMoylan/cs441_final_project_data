STYLE_DESCRIPTIONS = {
    "carrie": """
    Carrie Bradshaw's unified style signature is eclectic, risk-taking, and visually expressive, built
    around unexpected pairings and a high-low mix of fashion elements. Core indicators include tulle or
    midi skirts, slip dresses, camis and tube tops, straight-leg or low-rise jeans, and distinctive statement
    heels. Her outfits often feature romantic or feminine components—soft or flowing fabrics, playful textures,
    floral details—and accessories that act as focal points, such as unique handbags, oversized flowers, quirky
    hats, or boldly shaped jewelry. She consistently blends vintage or thrift-inspired pieces with couture-like
    items, and she embraces vibrant colors, Y2K influences, and silhouettes that create a "shouldn't work but
    does" effect.

    Layering complexity and proportion play an important role: dramatic coats, oversized outerwear, skirts
    over pants, dresses layered with shirts, or streetwear elements paired with elegant pieces. Carrie favors
    expressive combinations that feel spontaneous but intentional, with a signature balance of whimsy, romance,
    and personal flair. Outfits that convey experimentation, individuality, and a playful yet polished aesthetic—
    especially those mixing textures, eras, or formality levels—are highly consistent with her overall style.

    "charlotte": """
    Charlotte York's style is defined by polished femininity, structured silhouettes, and a consistent
    preference for classic, preppy, and refined pieces. Core indicators include A-line skirts, fit-and-flare
    dresses, pencil skirts, tailored trousers, crisp button-downs, cardigans, cashmere sweaters, and neutral
    or pastel basics. Her color palette skews toward blush pinks, soft blues, creams, florals, and other gentle
    tones. Accessories are minimal but elegant: pearl earrings, simple headbands, ballet flats, pointed-toe
    pumps, and structured handbags. She favors clean lines, timeless fabrics, and outfits that project order,
    composure, and traditional romantic femininity. Looks built from high-quality basics, polished layering,
    or classic prints such as gingham, plaid, or houndstooth strongly align with her aesthetic.

    Charlotte's wardrobe maintains a commitment to grace and refinement while maturing into richer colors,
    more luxurious fabrics, and more formal or powerful silhouettes. Additional markers include tailored coats,
    capes, tweed sets, waist-defining dresses, satin or silk blouses, and coordinated ensembles with an
    intentionally “put-together” finish. Her outfits rarely incorporate experimental pairings or chaotic textures;
    instead, they favor symmetry, balance, and traditional style norms. Any outfit that communicates elegance,
    preppy structure, feminine detailing (lace, bows, frills), and timeless chic—especially when anchored by
    pearls, court shoes, or polished outerwear—is strongly consistent with Charlotte York's overall fashion identity.

    "miranda": """
    Miranda Hobbes' style is defined by structured, functional clothing with an androgynous, minimalist
    edge. Key indicators include tailored blazers, structured coats, fitted trousers, pencil skirts, crisp
    button-downs, turtlenecks, and monochrome or neutral color palettes (black, grey, navy, olive). Her outfits
    prioritize clean lines, practicality, and professional sharpness rather than trend experimentation.
    Footwear tends toward loafers, block heels, boots, and other utilitarian silhouettes. Miranda often
    incorporates subtle masculine influences—suiting details, straight cuts, minimal embellishment—and favors
    sleek, simple accessories like stud earrings, leather totes, or briefcases. Occasional bold colors
    (especially reds and jewel tones) or strong statements like velvet suits or printed dresses appear but remain
    within a streamlined aesthetic. Outfits that communicate efficiency, confidence, and modern business
    sensibility align strongly with her style.

    Her range also includes more casual but still intentional basics: turtlenecks, tees under blazers,
    structured outerwear layered with denim or simple tops, and workwear-integrated casual pieces like trousers
    paired with relaxed shirts. Minimalist dresses—especially little black dresses with clean necklines—fit
    her understated formalwear profile. Even when leaning into softer or more experimental looks, the core traits
    remain: modest cuts, functional silhouettes, low embellishment, and a practical, polished presentation.
    An outfit is likely to fit Miranda if it emphasizes structure, simplicity, and a no-nonsense, contemporary
    professionalism with mild androgynous influence.

    "samantha": """
        Samantha Jones' style is defined by bold sensuality, high-impact glamour, and powerful formal dressing.
        Core indicators include body-conscious silhouettes (curve-hugging dresses, plunging necklines,
        thigh-high hems), saturated power colors (red, fuchsia, cobalt, emerald, gold), and dramatic fabrics
        such as sequins, satin, metallics, and animal prints. Her outfits frequently emphasize confident sexuality
        through fitted shapes, skin exposure, and statement accessories—oversized earrings, gold belts, glamorous
        coats, or standout handbags. Even her daywear leans formal and commanding: crisp sheath dresses, sharply
        tailored suits, pencil skirts, and consistently high heels. Any look built to attract attention, project
        dominance, or celebrate sensual confidence aligns strongly with Samantha's aesthetic.

        She also embodies a version of power dressing that blends 80s-coded elements—strong shoulders,
        bold prints, exaggerated accessories—with a comedic or ironic edge. Samantha avoids neutrals, preferring
        saturated, high-contrast palettes that instantly signal charisma. Her casual looks remain striking,
        often anchored by red dresses or fitted basics that highlight her silhouette. Outfits that communicate
        authority, glamour, and unapologetic confidence—even when slightly over-the-top—are highly characteristic
        of Samantha Jones.
